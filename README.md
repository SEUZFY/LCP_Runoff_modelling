# LCP implementation for flow direction and flow accumulation.
The idea is from this paper: https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/667/2011/

--HOW TO USE

Enter into:

**MajorSolution -> assignment2 -> x64 -> Release**, and you’ll be able to see **assignment2.exe** file, open the cmd window here and pass the FULL PATH of the input file, this FULL PATH is also where the generated files will go:

...\MajorSolution\assignment2\x64\Release>assignment2.exe FULLPATH

An example:

NB: If no argument is supplied, the program won’t execute the process of flow direction and 
flow accumulation.
